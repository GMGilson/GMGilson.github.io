## [OH-Bot](https://github.com/ECS-OH-Bot/OH-Bot) [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg)](https://GitHub.com/Naereen/StrapDown.js/graphs/commit-activity)


### Overview

OH-Bot is a self-hosted server managment automation bot for the Discord communication platform. OH-Bot is designed to help manage Office Hour sessions with instructors and students through Discord.
Students who are ready to be see by an instructor will be automatically notified and moved into a voice session to make online Office Hours more efficient.

Being self-hosted means that you will need to host
and maintain your own instance.

The standard OH-Session protocol that we follow: 
1. Instructors Opens OH-Queue 
2. Students enter queue and enter waiting room 
3. Instructors dequeue students 
4. Instructors close queue when OH-Session is over
   
### Purpose

With the need for online learning rising in demand, efficient means of reaching educators has become extremely important. As an undergraduate tutor and teaching assistant at UC Davis, I found the first party tools provided by the University to be insufficient at providing an efficient environment for instructors to hold office hours remotely.

We created this bot with the goal of allowing students to effectively
communicate with their instructors, with the option to be able to ask
their peers for help while they wait.

## [Missing CS Class](https://gitlab.com/missing-cs-quarter-ucd/lecture-slides) (In-Progress)

### [CERD Pitch](images/CERD_5-8-2020.pdf)
#### TL;DR

As an undergraduate tutor and teaching assistant at UC Davis, I have found many students uncomfotable with basic system tools in the *Nix enviornment such as:
* Package Managers
* Build Systems
* Version Control
* Command Line Interface

Familiarity in these systems are not only important in future courses at UC Davis, but in the industry as a whole. Inspired by a course developed at [MIT](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) to teach students these importatnt tools, The Missing CS Class is designed to improve students' knowledge of *Nix tools and skills for debugging.

### [Git GDB Refernece](https://github.com/GMGilson/Git-GDB-Tutorial) (Freshman-Fall 2019)

One of the main groups that I tutor are students in the lower-division CS-track at UC Davis. I found myself constatnly having to explain how to use Git and Gdb in my sessions. I wrote these docs to show some quick examples on how to use these tools with some advance topics that I find very cool!
