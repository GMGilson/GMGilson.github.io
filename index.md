### Overview

OH-Bot is a server managment automation bot. This means that tasks
like notifying and moving students when they are ready to been seen are
handled by OH-Bot

OH-Bot is a self-hotsted bot - meaning that you will need to host
and maintain your own instance. See [Quick Start](#quickstart) to get
started.

The standard OH-Session protocol that we follow: 
1. Instructors Opens OH-Queue 
2. Students enter queue and enter waiting room 
3. Instructors dequeue students 
4. Instructors close queue when OH-Session is over
   
### Purpose

With the need for online learning becoming increasingly higher in demand,
efficient means of reaching educators has become extremely important. We
implemented a discord bot to help instructors automate the process of
their Office Hours through Discord.

We created this bot with the goal of allowing students to effectively
communicate with their instructors, with the option to be able to ask
their peers for help while they wait.

### TL;DR
#### [Elevator Pitch](images/CERD_5-8-2020.pdf)
As an undergraduate tutor and teaching assistant at UC Davis, I have found many students uncomfotable with basic system tools in the *Nix enviornment such as:
* Package Managers
* Build Systems
* Version Control
* Command Line Interface

Familiarity in these systems are not only important in future courses at UC Davis, but in the industry as a whole. Inspired by a course developed at [MIT](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) to teach students these importatnt tools, this course is desigend to improve students' knowledge of straegies and skills for using the *Nix tools and debugging.
