## [OH-Bot](https://github.com/ECS-OH-Bot/OH-Bot)

### Overview

OH-Bot is a self-hosted server managment automation bot. 
Students who are ready to be see by the instructor will be automatically notified and moved into a voice session to streamline the process of office hours remotely.

Being self-hosted means that you will need to host
and maintain your own instance.

The standard OH-Session protocol that we follow: 
1. Instructors Opens OH-Queue 
2. Students enter queue and enter waiting room 
3. Instructors dequeue students 
4. Instructors close queue when OH-Session is over
   
### Purpose

With the need for online learning rising in demand,
efficient means of reaching educators has become extremely important. We
implemented a discord bot to help instructors automate the process of
their Office Hours through Discord.

We created this bot with the goal of allowing students to effectively
communicate with their instructors, with the option to be able to ask
their peers for help while they wait.

### [CERD Pitch](images/CERD_5-8-2020.pdf)
#### TL;DR

As an undergraduate tutor and teaching assistant at UC Davis, I have found many students uncomfotable with basic system tools in the *Nix enviornment such as:
* Package Managers
* Build Systems
* Version Control
* Command Line Interface

Familiarity in these systems are not only important in future courses at UC Davis, but in the industry as a whole. Inspired by a course developed at [MIT](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) to teach students these importatnt tools, this course is designed to improve students' knowledge of straegies and skills for using the *Nix tools and debugging.
